# AutoCRM Brain Lift

## 1. Purpose

AutoCRM aims to reimagine customer support by focusing on intelligence and automation rather than just ticket management. While traditional CRM systems treat support as a linear process, we view it as a learning ecosystem where:

- Every customer interaction contributes to organizational knowledge
- Support patterns inform product development
- AI assists rather than replaces human support
- Customer success is measured by resolution quality, not just speed

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- Intelligent ticket routing based on agent expertise and workload
- Knowledge base that evolves from actual support interactions
- API-first architecture for extensibility
- Real-time collaboration tools for support teams
- Customizable workflows that adapt to team patterns

### Out of Scope
- Sales pipeline management
- Marketing automation
- Complex billing/subscription management
- Deep social media integration
- On-premise deployment options

## 4. Spiky POVs

### Controversial Viewpoints
1. **"First Response Time is a vanity metric"**
   - Quality of resolution matters more than speed
   - Quick responses often lead to longer resolution times

2. **"Ticket deflection shouldn't be a primary goal"**
   - Focus on customer education instead of reducing tickets
   - Support interactions are opportunities for product insight

3. **"AI should enhance agents, not replace them"**
   - AI for research and context, humans for decision-making
   - Automation of process, not judgment

4. **"Traditional tiered support is obsolete"**
   - Skills-based routing is more efficient than levels
   - Every agent should be empowered to own customer outcomes
